Hello! In this repository you will find the following:

  - "Project 1 - Spring 2024.pdf" - project description file from the professor explaining the project and its deliverables
  - "Project 1 Outline.docx" - my personal outline for the project, including a schedule I held myself accountable to
  - "grade screenshot.png" - my grade for this assignment (100%)

In this project I was tasked with creating a simulation of a digital storefront using a graphical user interface. The program prompts users to enter an item ID and quantity, which the program will add to the cart (an array of 5 elements) if the ID is valid and there is enough of the item in stock. When the user hits the "check out" button, the program will display a small window with the calculated total adjusted for tax and discount, as well as a breakdown of the elements in the shopping cart. This information will then be exported to a .csv file that cannot be overwritten or erased within the program. For more information about the scope of the project, please view "Project 1 - Spring 2024.pdf"
